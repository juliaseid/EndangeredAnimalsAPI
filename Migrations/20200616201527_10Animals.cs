Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that prohibited harvest of all marine turtle species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990).  In 2000, the new National Program for Protection, Conservation, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,  proposed strategies and actions for the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that nest in Mexico.<br/><br/>In 1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and expanded their use to the Pacific in 1997. Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority.  The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In 1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females, their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>Today, general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests. When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling. Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em> nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests, they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Since 1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some equipment.<br/><br/>FWS, Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island beginning in 2000.<br/><br/>Educational programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999). Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the mid-2000s. &#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2. United States</em><br/>Development of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state law in 1987. &#160; From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since 1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000). <br/><br/>In addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure through the Shrimp Conservation Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001). The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting period. Several rules were adopted in the early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles, particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening or July 15. <br/><br/>Other gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. The State of Georgia requires the use of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160; Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states and in Federal waters.&#160; Several regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5 cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat, is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment. Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration and development occur at PAIS. The NPS and FWS work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle. Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict measures. Patrols are conducted at PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>", "US, MX", "<p>The Kemp's Ridley has one of the most restricted distributions of all sea turtles (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010; see range map and Figure 1 in Supplementary Information). This species is primarily distributed throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973; Marquez 1984, 1994; Pritchard 2007), with rare occurrences&#160; along the Atlantic coasts of Canada, Europe, as well as Bermuda, the Azores, Madeira, and the Mediterranean Sea (Carr and Caldwell 1956;&#160;Carr 1957, 1980; Mowbray and Caldwell 1958; Zwinenberg 1977; Brongersma <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 1979; Brongersma 1982; Bolton and Martins 1990; Tomás <em>et al</em>. 2003; Marquez-M.&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004; Guzman-Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 2007; Witt <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007; Tomás and Raga 2008;&#160;Ernst and Lovich 2009; Insacco and Spadola 2010; Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2015; Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2015). Nesting is primarily restricted to the western Gulf of Mexico, ranging from Texas, United States, to Veracruz, Mexico, with the majority of nesting occurring on an approximate 30 km stretch of the primary nesting beach with an epicenter located near Playa de Rancho Nuevo, in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994, Pritchard 2007, NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011, Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2016b).</p>", "The Kemp's Ridley inhabits coastal areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Hildebrand 1982, Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994) (Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (see Geographic Range for detailed range/distribution). Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie <em>et al</em>. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013; Shaver <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale <em>et al</em>. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‘oceanic’) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington <em>et al.</em> 2012, Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013, McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017). These areas of the GoM and Atlantic represent important developmental and foraging habitat for both oceanic and neritic life history stages of the Kemp's Ridley. &#160;&#160;For further information on Kemp's Ridley habitat use and ecology, see reviews in NMFS <em>et al</em>.

This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.<br/><br/>Population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle Population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>", "unknown", "Lepidochelys kempii", "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g. incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947 Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data&#160;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">(<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3% reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e. estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information). Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80% decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80% (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season), and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since 1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on 30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Population of mature individuals (adult males and females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>", 11533, "<p>As reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011), and the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle 5-year Review (NMFS and USFWS 2015), the major threats to the Kemp's Ridley vary seasonally and geographically throughout their distribution and include:<br/>1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (bottom trawls)<br/>2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (top &amp; midwater trawl, demersal gillnet, hook &amp; line commercial, hook &amp; line recreational, boat strikes)<br/>3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (pelagic longline, demersal longline, drift &amp; sink gillnet, pot)<br/>4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Predation<br/>5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cold stunning<br/>6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pollution, impact of marine debris<br/>7)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Climate Change<br/>8)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Illegal harvest<br/>9)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industrial plant intake/entrainment<br/>10)&#160; Dredging<br/>11)&#160; Ecosystem alterations<br/>12)&#160; Beach vehicular traffic<br/>13)&#160; Natural catastrophes (e.g. hurricanes)<br/>14) Toxins<br/>15) Oil spills.</p>" },

Ferret habitat selection at fine scales is dependent on density of prairie-dog burrow openings (Eads&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013).&#160;It has been estimated that about 40-60 hectares of prairie-dog colony are needed to support one Black-footed Ferret.

Multiple techniques and approaches are currently being developed and tested to reduce direct and indirect threats caused by plague.<br/><br/>Populations of Black-footed Ferrets declined throughout the 20th century to near extinction by the late 1970s (Biggins and Schroeder 1988). A small remnant population (around 100 animals or fewer; Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) was discovered in 1981 near Meeteetse, in northwestern Wyoming, but that population was decimated by canine distemper and plague&#160;in 1985 (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 1988).<br/><br/>Another major threat is the loss of habitat by conversion of grasslands to agricultural uses; the remaining habitat is now fragmented by great expanses of cropland and human development.

A Mandatory Ship Reporting Scheme has been in place since 1999 in two areas in the Right Whale calving and summering grounds to enable vessels to be warned of whales in the area. Regulations specify minimum approach distances for whale-watching and other vessels. Regulations are in place in the U.S. involving restrictions on certain types of fishing gear in areas and times where Right Whales are common (NOAA Fisheries 2016).</p> <p>The Atlantic Right Whale is listed in Appendix I of both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.<strong></strong></p>", "US, CA", "The Right Whale formerly was common on both sides of the North Atlantic. It appears to be effectively extirpated in the eastern North Atlantic but in the past probably ranged from a calving ground in the Golfo de Cintra (23°N) off Western Sahara, through the Azores, Bay of Biscay, western British Isles, and the Norwegian Sea to the North Cape (hence the Dutch name Noordkaper). In the western North Atlantic the species migrates from a calving ground off Florida and Georgia along the eastern seaboard of North America, to summering grounds in the Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Saint Lawrence. <p></p><p>Today, North Atlantic Right Whales are regularly surveyed in the winter calving ground off Florida and Georgia, and in spring/summer feeding grounds in Cape Cod Bay, the Great South Channel off Massachusetts, the Gulf of Maine, the Scotian Shelf, the Bay of Fundy, and increasingly in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, but not all the whales using the wintering ground are seen in these major summering areas (IWC 2001a). There have been a few sightings off Cape Farewell (southern tip of Greenland) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2007) and Iceland (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the Gulf of Mexico (Ward-Geiger <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p> <p></p><p>There have been very few sightings in the northeast Atlantic in recent times. A possible Right Whale was sighted in the Bay of Biscay in 1977 (Aguilar 1981) and a cow-calf pair was sighted off Cape Vincent, Portugal in 1995 (Martin and Walker 1997). A survey of the former Cintra Bay calving ground off Western Sahara failed to locate any Right Whales (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 1998). A sighting off Norway in 1999 was identified as an animal from the western North Atlantic population (Jacobsen <em>et al.</em> 2004). A Right Whale sighted in the Azores in January 2009 matched an individual sighted in September 2008 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Silva <em>et al.</em> 2012). There have been unconfirmed reports from northwestern Ireland and the Canary Islands.&#160; </p><p></p><p>The distribution map shows where the species may occur, based on oceanography. The species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are indicated in the list of range states as \"native\". <br/></p>", "Right Whales feed on calanoid copepods and other small invertebrates (smaller copepods, euphausids (krill), pteropods, and larval barnacles), generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the surface. The most common prey species is the copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus </em>(Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. 2007). <p>Relative abundance of Right Whales has been positively correlated with copepod density off the northeastern coast of the United States (Pendleton <em>et al.</em> 2009), and also correlated with sea surface temperature, sediment type, and bathymetry (Good 2008). Baumgartner and Mate (2005) attached satellite-monitored radio tags to Right Whales in the Bay of Fundy in order to investigate their habitat use. They found that when the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundances of <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> are thought to be high. Instead, the whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification. No evidence was found that the tagged Right Whales associated with oceanic fronts or regions with high standing stocks of phytoplankton.</p> Good (2008) investigated the relationship between Right Whale distribution and physical oceanographic conditions in an attempt to create predictive models of essential habitat for the species. The model correctly identified well documented current and historical calving grounds in the eastern North Atlantic, and suggested that suitable calving habitat on the east coast of the United States may extend farther north than is currently recognized. In the Gulf of Maine, Right Whale distribution was correlated primarily with sea surface temperature, sediment type and bathymetry. The predictive models employed by Good (2008) offered insights into habitat preferences for foraging but failed to wholly capture the physical factors underlying Right Whale distribution.", null, "<strong>Current status</strong><br/><br/><em>Northwestern Atlantic<br/></em>Based mainly on photo-identification data, the North Atlantic Right Whale population was estimated to have been increasing at an average rate of 2.8% per year from 1990 to 2010, peaking at about 480 individuals in 2010. Abundance declined slightly from 2010 to 2015, following a run of years of below average reproduction which is reflected in both lower calf counts and longer calving intervals (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017). The best recent estimate is 468 animals (95% credible interval 444-471) in 2015. Associated with a lower estimated survival rate for females, the female proportion in the population is estimated to be only about 40%, despite a birth sex ratio close to 50:50. The abundance will have declined further in 2017 given 17 documented deaths (including 12 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada, and five in northeastern U.S. waters), in 2017 or nearly 4% of the population (NOAA Fisheries 2018).<br/><br/>There has also been a change since 2011 in the Atlantic Right Whales' patterns of habitat use (IWC 2017). There may have been a northward shift in summer distribution into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, leaving fewer whales in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine (Stokstad 2017) but increased observations in the Gulf may also have been due to an increase in observer effort that has not been quantified across the years (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The rate of increase of North Atlantic Right Whales compares unfavourably with that of Southern Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). While known cases of human-caused mortality (entanglements and ship strikes) up to 2016 averaged only about 1% of the population annually (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), entanglement-caused deaths probably exceed the known cases because death is not always immediate. An analysis of individuals observed to be entangled in fishing gear between 1995 and 2008 showed approximately 25% lower survival rates than whales not seen to be carrying gear (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2015). The occurrence of skin lesions of a kind not seen in Southern Right Whales was recorded in North Atlantic Right Whales during the period 1995 to 2002, and appeared to be correlated with the failure to reproduce of females that would normally have been ready to calve (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Over the same period, body condition as measured by blubber thickness was poorer in the North Atlantic whales than in Southern Right Whales (IWC 2001b).<br/><br/>Calf counts have been conducted since 1980, and calf production has fluctuated. It was particularly low during 1998-2000 and again during 2010-2017 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Years of low calf production have been correlated with environmental conditions (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2003) and with poor body condition of adults (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). Based on the pattern of occurrence on the calving ground of females at different stages in the calving cycle, Browning et al. (2010) were able to infer that there is considerable cryptic perinatal mortality in addition to known calf deaths. For the period 1989-2003, they documented 191 surviving calves and 17 known calf deaths and estimated a further 28 cryptic calf deaths. The mean interval between successful calvings appears to be longer for North Atlantic Right Whales than for Southern Right Whales (Browning et al. 2010) although the published estimates are not fully comparable.<br/><br/><em>Northeastern Atlantic</em><br/>Due to the paucity of records in recent times (see the Geographic Range section), and the fact that at least some of the records are migrants from the west, it is not clear whether there is a remnant northeastern Atlantic breeding population. It is also unclear whether in the past the animals in the northern part of the range (off Iceland and Norway) belonged mainly to the western or eastern breeding populations, or to what degree the two breeding populations were separate.<br/><br/><em>Historical population size</em><br/>The first records of Basque whaling in the Bay of Biscay are from the 11th century. At least dozens of Right Whales were taken each year in the Bay of Biscay until a marked decline was evident by 1650, and whaling declined during the 18th century. Basque whalers arrived in Iceland as early as 1412, and participated in the Right Whale fishery around the British Isles and Norway from the 14th to the 18th century, but probably many more whales were taken by Dutch, Danish, British, and Norwegian whalers. Quantitative estimates of catches are not available. Historic Right Whale catches as far north as Iceland and Norway appear to have been mainly <em>E. glacialis</em>, with Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) being the main species only in the far north (Greenland and Svalbard) (Aguilar 1986). Smith <em>et al</em>. (2006) documented extensive whaling for Right Whales in the North Cape area (northern Norway) in the 17th century. Right Whale hunting in the northeastern Atlantic seems to have declined from the mid-17th century and all but disappeared by the mid-18th century, but there was a brief period of Right Whale catches by modern whalers operating from shore stations in the northwestern British Isles and off Iceland, with at least 120 Right Whales taken during 1881-1924 (Collett 1909, Brown 1986). The last recorded catch was a cow-calf pair off Madeira in 1967, accompanied by a third individual that escaped.<br/><br/>It is not clear when Basque whaling first spread to the northwestern North Atlantic, but it had been established no later than 1530. It had long been thought that large numbers (tens of thousands) of Right Whales were taken off Labrador and Newfoundland by the Basques between 1530 and 1610 (Aguilar 1986, Reeves 2001) but recent genetic evidence suggest that many if not most of these were Bowheads (Rastogi <em>et al</em>. 2004, McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2008). Shore-based whaling along the U.S. east coast began in the mid 17th century and continued at least sporadically over the next two and a half centuries (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Historical catches, particularly in the northeastern Atlantic, are insufficiently documented to allow estimation of the pre-whaling population size. Monsarrat <em>et al</em>. (2016) used historical catches in the North Pacific, which are better documented, to relate pre-whaling Right Whale summer abundance to habitat parameters, and then applied this relationship to the North Atlantic. This resulted in an estimated pre-whaling total abundance in the North Atlantic of 9,000-21,000, based on ecological carrying capacity. Much of this population is predicted to have summered in the Norwegian Sea and on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>The historical population reductions occurred more than three generations ago, hence they do not trigger the Red List population reduction criteria (A).", "decreasing", "Eubalaena glacialis", "The best recent (2015) estimate of the number of North Atlantic Right Whales is 458 (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017), which would correspond to about 266 mature individuals using the fraction mature of 0.58 (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using the lower 95% credible interval of the estimate (444) results in an estimate of 258 mature individuals. Given the evidence that the population has been declining since 2010, the mortality event in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, in 2017 which will have accelerated the decline, and the low proportion of females in the population (about 40%), a classification as Endangered under IUCN Red List criterion D remains appropriate at this time. If the recent decline continues, the species should be reclassified as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii).", 41712, "Right Whales in the North Atlantic are no longer hunted, and the most serious current threat is death or injury from entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with ships off the east coast of North America (Kraus <em>et al.</em> 2016). During 2010-2014, there were 29 confirmed human-caused deaths or serious injuries, including 24 entanglements and five ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Because some anthropogenic deaths probably pass undetected, the reported events are considered minima. Entanglement events appear to be increasing in both frequency and severity (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><p>An examination of photo-identification photographs revealed that most individual Right Whales (82.9%) possess evidence of being entangled at least once while over half (59.0%) of the individuals have been entangled more than once. The evidence suggests that Right Whales acquire new entanglement scars on an annual basis, juvenile whales at a higher rate than adults (Knowlton<em> et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement events that are initially sublethal probably also result in excess mortality over time. Based on observations during 1995-2008 of 50 free-living individuals observed to be carrying fishing gear, compared with 459 individuals never seen with gear during that period, Robbins <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated an excess mortality of approximately 25% during the first year after which the individual was first seen with gear. Because some fatalities may occur before the whale is seen with gear, this provides a minimum estimate of the fatality rate of entangled whales in addition to the immediate fatalities. &#160; <br/></p> <p><em></em></p>In the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (Canada), groundfish hook-and-line gear had been found to pose the greatest risk to Right Whales during the summer, and lobster fisheries during the spring and autumn migration periods (Vanderlaan <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, of 12 right whale deaths recorded in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in summer 2017, 6 could be examined, and the cause of death was found to be entanglement in snow crab fishing gear in 2 cases and suspected to be blunt trauma consistent with vessel strike in 4 cases. In addition, five live whales were found entangled including at least four in snow crab gear. Three of those whales were freed by human intervention or freed themselves, and the fate of the remaining two is unknown (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017, Taylor and Walker 2017).<br/><p>Right Whales appear to be the most vulnerable large whales to ship strikes (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2007). Ship strikes were found to be the cause of death for 53% of the 40 Right Whales necropsied between 1970 and 2006 and could be responsible for up to 10 individual Right Whale deaths per year (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2009). Known Right Whale deaths due to ship strikes have declined from 2.0 (2000–2006) to 1.0 per year (2010–2014) (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The decrease may be due, in part, to spatial mitigation efforts (so-called Seasonal Management Areas, or SMAs) implemented in U.S. waters in 2008 (Hoop <em>et al. </em>2015). The SMAs were designed to correspond to Right Whale feeding, calving, and migration areas and it is estimated that this mitigation effort reduced mortality by 80-90% (Conn and Silber 2013). The risk of ship strike was reduced by an estimated 82% due to an “Area to Be Avoided” vessel-routing initiative implemented by the International Maritime Organization in the Roseway Basin Area on the Scotian Shelf (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2009).<br/> </p><p>Low-frequency in-water noise from shipping activity has been linked to physiological stress (increased glucocorticoid levels) in North Atlantic Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al.</em> 2012). Acoustic masking from anthropogenic noise (especially ship noise) may negatively impact reproduction by interfering with courtship vocalizations and may negatively impact prey acquisition by reducing communication and feeding opportunities (Hatch <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/></p><p>Environmental neurotoxins produced as a result of harmful algal blooms have the potential to cause negative effects on reproduction and development. Paralytic shellfish toxin and domoic acid that were detected in fecal samples indicate that Right Whales are exposed to environmental neurotoxins on an annual basis for up to six months of the year (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2002, Doucette <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>No population-level increase in mortality rates had been detected up to 2015, and the estimated population decline during 2010-15 appears to have been due to poor reproduction (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017). The reduced reproduction may have been related to the apparent decline in average body condition (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016) which may in turn be related to some of the influences discussed above. The high number of deaths recorded in 2017, at nearly 4% of the population size, will have accelerated the population decline.<br/></p> <p></p> <p></p>" },

Kellogg and Goldman (1944) tentatively attributed a series of skulls 25 skulls from the collection of Adolph H. Schultz (no skins, but reported to have been light coloured) from Río La Vaca, near Puerto Armmuelles, Burica Peninsula to <em>A. g. azuerensis</em>. Baldwin and Baldwin (1976) found no evidence that spider monkeys ever occurred in the Province of Chiriquí. Konstant <em>et al</em>. (1985) reported that the Azuero Pensinula was widely deforested and that subspecies is likely to be surviving only in western parts. <br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi frontatus</em> is believed to range through northwestern Costa Rica and extreme western and northern Nicaragua (Kellogg and Goldman 1944). Specimens from Nicaragua examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from the following localities: Lavala; Peña Blanca; Río Siquia; Río Yoya, a tributary of the Río Princapolca; Tuma and Uluce. Allen (1908, 1910) recorded <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>from the east slope of the Nicaraguan highlands, Savala (800 ft), Tuma (1,000 ft), Peña Blanca (high point in low Atlantic coast forests, 1,500 ft) and Uluce (about 1,000 ft), and in the highlands of northern Nicaragua at Matagalpa (2,000 ft).<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi grisescens</em> is a subspecies of doubtful validity. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) presumed that it occurred in the valley of the Río Tuyra and probably south-eastward through the Serranía del Sapo of extreme south-eastern Panama and the Cordillera de Baudó of north-western Colombia. Matamoros and Seal (2001) indicate its occurrence in the basin of the lower Río Tuira in Panama and the frontier zone with Colombia. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) indicated Cerro Pirre or Río Tucutí as marking the limits of its range with <em>A. f. rufiventris </em>to the north. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) indicated that <em>grisescens</em> occurs in Colombia: “…[it] is known only from the vicinity of Juradó very near the Panamanian border on the Pacific coast. It is undoubtedly restricted by the Baudó Mountains to a narrow coastal strip that may extend as far south as Cabo Corrientes.” (p.66). Defler <em>et al</em>. (2003) recorded that there is no recent information regarding its presence or otherwise along the Panamanian border, but that colonists near the northern parts of the Serranía de Baudó region talk of two “types” of <em>Ateles</em>, one in the lowlands (definitely <em>A. fusciceps</em>) and another form above 500–600 m altitude (J. V. Rodríguez-M. unpubl.), the only real suggestion that this taxon might actually be present in Colombia. <em>A. fusciceps</em> in the central part of the Sierra de Baudó would indicate that the occurrence of <em>grisescens</em> therefore would be limited to the portion immediately abutting Panama, and not the entire mountain range (Defler <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi ornatus</em> is found in forested regions of Panama, east of the Canal Zone (Cordillera San Blas), and west through Chiriquí to central western Costa Rica. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) give the following localities as marking the eastern limit of its range: San Juan, Cerro Brujo, Cerro Azul and Río Pequeñi—all on or within the boundary line of the Madden Lake watershed, and nowhere more than 30 miles east of the Panama Canal. The Río Bayano basin just to the east is occupied by <em>A. fusciceps rufiventris</em> (see Handley 1966; Heltne and Kunkel 1975). This is the spider monkey of the Osa Peninsula, Corcovado National Park and Carara Biological Reserve in Costa Rica (Matamoros and Seal 2001). The population on the Island of Barro Colorado is introduced (Carpenter 1935; J. F. Eisenberg pers. comm. in Konstant <em>et al</em>. 1985). Crockett <em>et al</em>. (1997; see also Cody 1994; Querol <em>et al</em>. 1996) observed spider monkeys in the Refugio Bartola / Reserva Indio-Maíz (300,000 ha), along the Río Bartola, north of the Río San Juan along the frontier with Costa Rica. They were unable to identify the subspecies but said that, unlike <em>A. g. geoffroyi</em>, they were “distinctly reddish on the back and on the top of the tail; the ends of the limbs were dark” (p.73). <br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus</em> occurs in the forests of Veracruz and eastern San Luis Potosí and south-eastward through Tabasco, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in eastern Oaxaca, including the highlands of Guatemala (thought by Kellogg and Goldman [1944] to have been occupied by <em>A. g. pan</em>, here considered a synonym) through El Salvador and Honduras, including the north coast to the lowlands of the Mosquitia in the Department of Gracias a Dios.<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis</em> occurs in the forests of the Yucatán peninsula, north-eastern Guatemala, and adjoining parts of Belize, intergrading to the south in Mexico (Campeche) and Guatemela with <em>vellerosus</em>. Parra Lara and Jorgenson (1998) reported on a survey of 36 localities in the state of Quintana Roo. They confirmed the presence of spider monkeys in 11 of them, and received reports of their occurrence in a further 19, extending from the Ejido Tres Garantias in the south to locations way in the north, near Cancún, at Cenote Notnozot. Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco (2003) have studied the population size and habitat use of <em>A. g. yucatanensis</em> around the Punta Laguna, Quintana Roo.", "Occurs in primary lowland rain forest, evergreen and semideciduous, and will enter deciduous forest (Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica: Freese 1976; Ortiz-Martínez and Rico-Gray 2007)<br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus </em>was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (most usually 2-4), the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group sizes of <em>A. geoffroyi</em> can range from 16-24 (Di Fiore and Campbell 2007). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a “core area” of the group’s home range which she uses most. Klein and Klein (1976, 1977) estimated 259-388 ha ranges with 20-30% overlap for <em>A. belzebuth</em> in La Macarena National Park, Colombia. <em>Ateles</em> are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees.<br/><br/>Freese (1976) recorded high numbers of infants in the dry season (December-May) in the Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976; see also Milton 1981; Chapman and Chapman 1990). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Adult male weight 7.42-9.00 kg (mean 8.26 kg, n=56), adult female weight 6.0-9.4 kg (mean 7.7 kg, n = &gt;100) (Ford and Davis 1992).", null, "<em>Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis</em><br/>A total of 112 - 116 individuals has been estimated for this subspecies (Mendez-Carvajal, Ruiz-Bernard, Franco and Silva, in prep.).<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis</em><br/>Cant (1978) estimated 24.5 individuals/km² at Tikal, Guatemala. Coelho <em>et al.</em> (1976) estimated a higher density of 45 individuals/km². Populaions of this species can be very high in well prtoected areas: Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco, 2003) recorded 89.5 individuals/km² in what they refer to as \"relatively undisturbed semi-evergreen medium forest [as opposed to successional forest] with trees up to 20 m in height\" at Punta Laguna, Quintana Roo.

The taxonomy of the subspecies needs to be revisited.", 2279, "The major threat to this species is habitat loss, with several subspecies having been subject to very high rates of loss (see, for example, Cuarón 1997; Sánchez-Azofeifa <em>et al</em>. 2001; Velázquez and Estrada 2002). However, there remain several large areas of relatively continuous habitat in the Selva Maya (Mexico, Guatemala and Belize), in the Atlantic zone of Nicaragua and Honduras, and along the Atlantic coast and the Darien in Panama. The species is also subject to exploitation in pet trafficking in some areas and is hunted in some regions." }
