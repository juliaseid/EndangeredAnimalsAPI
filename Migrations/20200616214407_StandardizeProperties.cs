A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding and reintroduction programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park is preventing extinction in the wild. The success of the scheme has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to an annual hatch of 25-30 birds in recent years (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. The genetic diversity of the population has been maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. \"Aversion training\" to avoid powerlines and humans is practised (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>. A total of 154 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2003 (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to help prevent lead-poisoning, and community education programmes aim to minimise persecution (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong>. However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than before and are less likely to take the food provided for them (Bakker <em>et al. </em>2017). A huge step has been taken towards eliminating the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, which requires the use of non-lead ammunition within the species's range in California and was implemented in 2008. As of February 2009, 99% of hunters were compliant with the act. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is now distributing safer lead-substitute bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors; similar programmes are being initiated in California (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and Utah. Public awareness and engagement are continuing to increase, working toward the elimination of lead ammunition and the removal of lead-tainted carcasses from the field (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). By 2019, a California-wide ban of lead ammunition is scheduled to go into effect (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity measures include a website and near-weekly condor articles in local newspapers (D. Cooper and J. Grantham<em> in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>.

Resume release programme in Mexico and establish new release sites in northern California. Maintain and increase the productivity of the captive population. Continue releases of captive-bred birds<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Maintain suitable habitat (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Marmots expanded into new habitats created by clearcut logging of high-elevation primary forests during the 1980s; numbers increased to an estimated 300-350 individuals by 1986, with about half of these living in clearcuts (Bryant and Janz 1996). The temporary population expansion was followed by precipitous decline and near-extinction in the wild (Bryant 2000).

The primary threats to this species include native predators, ecosystem modification arising from post-logging forest succession, and longer term predicted habitat loss associated with climate change.&#160;<br/><br/>Logging activities adjacent to colonies have created temporarily attractive habitat to marmots and have undoubtedly resulted in an increase in marmot populations. Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as \"sinks\" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of <em>M. vancouverensis</em> is not viable using existing criteria.<br/><br/>Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality.

Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that prohibited harvest of all marine turtle species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990).  In 2000, the new National Program for Protection, conservationmeasures, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,  proposed strategies and actions for the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that nest in Mexico.<br/><br/>In 1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and expanded their use to the Pacific in 1997. Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority.  The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In 1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females, their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>Today, general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests. When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling. Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em> nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests, they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Since 1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some equipment.<br/><br/>FWS, Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island beginning in 2000.<br/><br/>Educational programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999). Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the mid-2000s. &#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2. United States</em><br/>Development of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state law in 1987. &#160; From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since 1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000). <br/><br/>In addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure through the Shrimp conservationmeasures Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001). The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting period. Several rules were adopted in the early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles, particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening or July 15. <br/><br/>Other gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. The State of Georgia requires the use of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160; Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states and in Federal waters.&#160; Several regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5 cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat, is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment. Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration and development occur at PAIS. The NPS and FWS work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle. Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict measures. Patrols are conducted at PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>", "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen <em>et al</em>. 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.<br/><br/>population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>", "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g. incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947 Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data&#160;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">(<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3% reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e. estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information). Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80% decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80% (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season), and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since 1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on 30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>population of mature individuals (adult males and females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>", "Lepidochelys kempii" });

The success of the scheme has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to an annual hatch of 25-30 birds in recent years (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. The genetic diversity of the population has been maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. \"Aversion training\" to avoid powerlines and humans is practised (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>.

However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than before and are less likely to take the food provided for them (Bakker <em>et al. </em>2017). A huge step has been taken towards eliminating the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, which requires the use of non-lead ammunition within the species's range in California and was implemented in 2008. As of February 2009, 99% of hunters were compliant with the act.

Conservative estimates are 140-190 marmot in the wild, based on field counts. Bryant (2005) reported the following: \"Population counts began in 1979 and have continued, with variable coverage and intensity, until the present. Marmots expanded into new habitats created by clearcut logging of high-elevation primary forests during the 1980s; numbers increased to an estimated 300-350 individuals by 1986, with about half of these living in clearcuts (Bryant and Janz 1996). The temporary population expansion was followed by precipitous decline and near-extinction in the wild (Bryant 2000).

Numbers of adults were above average during the early 1980s and were reported as near or below average since 1990 by Bryant and Janz (1996).

The primary threats to this species include native predators, ecosystem modification arising from post-logging forest succession, and longer term predicted habitat loss associated with climate change.&#160;<br/><br/>Logging activities adjacent to colonies have created temporarily attractive habitat to marmots and have undoubtedly resulted in an increase in marmot populations. Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as \"sinks\" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of <em>M. vancouverensis</em> is not viable using existing criteria.<br/><br/>Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality.

Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that prohibited harvest of all marine turtle species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990).  In 2000, the new National Program for Protection, Conservation, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,  proposed strategies and actions for the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that nest in Mexico.<br/><br/>In 1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and expanded their use to the Pacific in 1997. Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority.  The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In 1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females, their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>Today, general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests. When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling. Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em> nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests, they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Since 1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some equipment.<br/><br/>FWS, Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island beginning in 2000.<br/><br/>Educational programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999). Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the mid-2000s. &#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2. United States</em><br/>Development of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state law in 1987. &#160; From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since 1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000). <br/><br/>In addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure through the Shrimp Conservation Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001). The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting period. Several rules were adopted in the early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles, particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening or July 15. <br/><br/>Other gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. The State of Georgia requires the use of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160; Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states and in Federal waters.&#160; Several regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5 cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat, is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment. Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration and development occur at PAIS. The NPS and FWS work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle. Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict measures. Patrols are conducted at PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>", "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen <em>et al</em>. 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.<br/><br/>Population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle Population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>", "Lepidochelys kempii", "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g. incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947 Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data&#160;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">(<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3% reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e. estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information). Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80% decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80% (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season), and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since 1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on 30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Population of mature individuals (adult males and females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>" });

The current populations result from massive efforts to reintroduce captive animals back to the wild. It was reintroduced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service into eight western states of the USA, one state in Mexico, and one province in Canada from 1991 to 2009.
