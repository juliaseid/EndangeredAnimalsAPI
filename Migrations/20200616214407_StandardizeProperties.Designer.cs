A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding and reintroduction programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park is preventing extinction in the wild. The success of the scheme has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to an annual hatch of 25-30 birds in recent years (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. The genetic diversity of the population has been maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. \"Aversion training\" to avoid powerlines and humans is practised (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>. A total of 154 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2003 (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to help prevent lead-poisoning, and community education programmes aim to minimise persecution (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong>. However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than before and are less likely to take the food provided for them (Bakker <em>et al. </em>2017). A huge step has been taken towards eliminating the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, which requires the use of non-lead ammunition within the species's range in California and was implemented in 2008. As of February 2009, 99% of hunters were compliant with the act. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is now distributing safer lead-substitute bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors; similar programmes are being initiated in California (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and Utah. Public awareness and engagement are continuing to increase, working toward the elimination of lead ammunition and the removal of lead-tainted carcasses from the field (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). By 2019, a California-wide ban of lead ammunition is scheduled to go into effect (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity measures include a website and near-weekly condor articles in local newspapers (D. Cooper and J. Grantham<em> in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. Legislation coming into force in early 2010 made it illegal for persons to enter a U.S. national park with a loaded firearm (Toops 2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/><strong>conservationmeasures Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends. Continue the recovery plan to achieve two disjunct, self-sustaining populations of 150 individuals comprising 15 breeding pairs. Identify further potential release sites in southern New Mexico (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong>. Resume release programme in Mexico and establish new release sites in northern California. Maintain and increase the productivity of the captive population. Continue releases of captive-bred birds<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Maintain suitable habitat (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Continue supplying alternative lead-free ammunition to deer hunters. Advocate strongly for a ban on lead ammunition and lobby the Fish and Game Commission to ensure legislation is passed.

Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002, and by February 2009 56 nesting attempts had been recorded, from which at least 19 chicks have fledged and survived (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. In December 2003, birds were released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California, where one pair were observed raising chicks in 2009 (Moir 2009)<strong></strong>. Releases in New Mexico have been abandoned due to lack of funding, and release priorities have shifted to identifying sites and partnerships in southern Sierra Nevada, California (Chu <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although one individual wandered north to Flaming Gorge (Wyoming) and localities in Colorado before returning to the Grand Canyon area. The California birds occur regularly in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, and probably Santa Cruz counties. By December 2006, there were 130 wild birds at five release sites (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006, <strong></strong>Graham 2006)<strong></strong>, including at least 44 that were over six years old, the earliest age at which the species breeds (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and in February 2012, the total population stood at 173 individuals in captivity and 213 in the wild, primarily in southern and central California (Carpentier 2009, C. N. Parish <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. In January 2010, the number of released birds that had produced viable offspring stood at 44, with another 60 birds of breeding age (J. Grantham <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. By 2017, the total population has increased to 446 birds (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). The Arizona/Utah population now numbers 78 birds, with four birds released in 2017 and another 10 earmarked for release in 2018 (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). <br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, <strong>Mexico</strong> in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick born in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where efforts are ongoing to increase the population to an anticipated carrying capacity of c.20 pairs (Wallace 2005)<strong></strong>. It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. 2015 was an important year for the species in terms of its recovery in the wild as it was the first year when the number of individuals that died in the wild was less than the number of juveniles that fledged (Silber 2016). Second generation birds have recently matured to breeding age, but no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (C. Battistone <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<p></p>",

N. Parish <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat for released birds (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007, Walters <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2010)<strong></strong>; 9 of 13 birds released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California had to be recaptured and tested for lead poisoning after feasting on a field of squirrel carcasses shot by hunters using lead-shot in 2006. It is particularly prone to the threat of lead-poisoning owing to its longevity and delayed-onset breeding strategy, and given the distances it travels to forage, meaning lead can build up in the blood to dangerous levels over many years having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2007)<strong></strong>. Shooting and accidental poisoning continue to be the principal threats to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007)<strong></strong>, but lead ammunition is being banned within the species's range in California and there are increasing indications that the federal government will gradually phase out the use of lead across the U.S. Despite efforts to reduce the threat of lead-poisoning, it is reported that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009)<strong></strong> and in January 2010 three birds were found to have died from lead-poisoning in northern Arizona. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors in the region are experiencing toxicological effects from lead ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). In preparation of a potential release at new sites in northern California, a study found that Common Ravens <em>Corvus corax</em>&#160;and Turkey Vultures <em>Cathartes aura</em>&#160;in the region still suffered from high lead contamination (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity and awareness raising campaigns appear to have successfully reduced persecution.&#160;<br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of the breakdown compounds of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to this population, it is thought that this is linked to feeding on the carcasses of predatory marine mammals that had been exposed to the pesticide from a specific point source during their lifetimes (Burnett<em> et al. </em>2013, Kurle <em>et al. </em>2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is a further significant impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in this population. Ingested anthropogenic material was recently responsible for the deaths of two nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other deaths<strong></strong>. The dead condors were found to have swallowed glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc. (Mee <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007)<strong></strong>. Two birds were shot in California in 2009. Both were alive as of April 2009, both being treated for lead poisoning (Anon. 2009)<strong></strong>. Puppet-reared birds may be more prone to exhibit problematic human-oriented behaviour such as tameness and vandalising property than parent-reared birds (Meretsky <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines, but this behavioural problem has been addressed using a conditioning programme with fake power poles (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. The spread of west Nile virus is not anticipated to be a problem for the species as most birds are vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. Overall survival of released birds has been high, although without the capture, treatment and re-release of lead contaminated birds it is likely that rates of mortality in the wild still exceed sustainable levels (Walters <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2010, L.

In a study covering a span of six years (from 1998 to 2004), axolotl density had reduced from 0.006-org/ m2 to 0.001-org/ m2, although it is thought that this reduction could also be due to its own population dynamics (Zambrano 2006). A recent scientific survey revealed no axolotls, although wild-caught animals are still found in the local market, which indicates that fishermen still know where to find them.

Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality.

Subalpine herbaceous communities with steep slopes support the largest populations (Nagorsen 1987). Common tree species in these communities are <em>Abies lasiocarpa</em>, <em>Tsuga mertensiana</em>, and <em>Chamaecyparis nootkatensis</em>; shrubs and herbs include <em>Vaccinium</em> spp., <em>Luetkea pectinata</em>, <em>Alnus sinuata</em>, <em>Erigeron peregrinus</em>, <em>Rhododendron albiflorum</em>, <em>Phlox diffusa</em>, <em>Anaphalis margaritacea</em>, <em>Aster foliaceus</em>, <em>Lupinus arcticus</em>, and <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em> (Milko 1984). Preferred lush forb/grass meadows are relatively rare on Vancouver Island; they generally are restricted to steep, south-facing slopes where avalanches and snow creep inhibit the growth of trees (Nagorsen 1987). Fire also creates favourable meadow habitat on subalpine slopes. Most marmot occurrences are on south- and west-facing slopes (Bryant and Janz 1996). Colonies have also been found in coniferous forest, logging clearcut slash, road banks, and cleared ski runs. In fact, half of the world's <em>M. vancouverensis</em> were living in clearcuts in 1997, compared to about 25% in the mid-1980s and none prior to high elevation logging that began in the late 1960s. Individual marmots occasionally take up residence in valley-bottom gardens (Munro 1985).<br/><br/>Marmots prefer areas with sufficient soil for burrowing, and with large rocks or stumps for burrowing under and for lookout sites. Burrows are usually below rocks in or near meadows. Young are born in underground burrows.&#160;<em>M. vancouverensis</em> is colonial. Colonies are relatively small and inhabit small habitat patches. Most are made up of one to three family units, and the average size before the young-of-the-year emerge is about eight individuals (Bryant 1990). Meta-populations of this species consist of a patchwork of colonies, each of which experiences periodic extinctions and recolonizations (Bryant and Janz 1996). Dispersal is a key ingredient of this pattern; the appearance of individual marmots in unusual habitats far from known colonies indicates that&#160;<em>M. vancouverensis</em> is capable of extensive dispersal through forested lands (Munro 1985). Year-to-year persistence of family groups has been measured at 43% in natural sites and at 13% in logging slash sites (Bryant 1990). Most mortality apparently occurs during hibernation. Survivorship varied dramatically from year to year in Bryant's (1990) study, but a small sample size prevented any accurate determination of a mean rate. Predation on <em>M. vancouverensis</em> has not been studied, but potential predators include <em>Canis lupus, Martes americana, Gulo gulo, Felis concolor, Ursus americanus, Buteo jamaicensis, Aquila chrysaetos, Accipiter gentilis</em>, and <em>Bubo virginianus</em> (Bryant 1990).&#160;Grasses and sedges are the most important food in early spring; forbs make up the bulk of the summer diet. Small fruits are also eaten. Hibernates from early October to early May.<br/><br/>There appears to be sufficient habitat for Vancouver Island Marmots, however the distribution of habitat relative to dispersal may make some habitat relatively inaccessible to active Marmot colonies.",

Conservative estimates are 140-190 marmot in the wild, based on field counts. Bryant (2005) reported the following: \"population counts began in 1979 and have continued, with variable coverage and intensity, until the present. Marmots expanded into new habitats created by clearcut logging of high-elevation primary forests during the 1980s; numbers increased to an estimated 300-350 individuals by 1986, with about half of these living in clearcuts (Bryant and Janz 1996). The temporary population expansion was followed by precipitous decline and near-extinction in the wild (Bryant 2000). Fewer than 130 marmots were known to be alive by 2004, including 93 in captivity and about 35 in the wild (unpublished minutes, Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, November 2004).\"&#160;In 2007 it was estimated that there were only about 85 individuals remaining in the wild with about 162 individuals remaining in captivity (Kruckenhauser <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since 2000, 579 pups (45% female) have been weaned in the captive population, 43 marmots reside between the Calgary and Toronto Zoos. Release of captive bred marmots begin in 2003 and from 2003-2016 there have been 490 captive marmots released into suitable habitat (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 100 marmots released are monitored using transmitters each year.&#160;<br/><br/>Since 1972, the species has been found at 47 sites on 15 mountains (Bryant and Janz 1996). However, only four occurrences are known to be extant.<br/><br/>population trends are difficult to determine because estimates of numbers and sizes of colonies before the 1970s are not available and only one or two relatively thorough censuses have been done (these only in the central part of the range). Numbers of adults were above average during the early 1980s and were reported as near or below average since 1990 by Bryant and Janz (1996). Recent data indicate a significant decline during the 1990s. Data for 1997 indicated a 60% decline in numbers during the past decade and a similar reduction in geographic range in the last several decades (Bryant <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>A thorough and systematic inventory of all of Vancouver Island, especially the western and northern mountains, is needed to determine the actual present status.",

Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as \"sinks\" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996).

Pygmy Raccoon prefers mangrove stands and sandy areas, but it is&#160;also found in semi-evergreen and sub-deciduous tropical forests and agricultural areas. Abundance varies considerable across&#160;vegetation types. Most of the population lives in the&#160;coastal areas of the island, and a large proportion of the central part of the island is&#160;uninhabited or has only a&#160;very low density. Pygmy Raccoon may inhabit areas near human settlements, and/or paved and unpaved roads (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoon is mainly nocturnal, although it is not uncommon to see it during daylight (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005).  Generally it is solitary, but sometimes forms&#160;family groups (Jones and Lawlor 1965,&#160;Cuarón&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). McFadden and Meiri (2013) concluded that dwarfism in the Pygmy Raccoon may be an insular adaptation to the fewer resources found on Cozumel Island compared with the mainland.<br/><br/>It is omnivorous, with a preference for crabs followed by fruits, insects, crayfish, and small vertebrates (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006). The relevance of the different food items varies strongly&#160;between seasons and sites, and following major changes in habitat quality because of hurricanes (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The Pygmy Raccoon is particularly vulnerable to introduced pathogens and diseases such as mange, rabies and dog distemper from exotic animals (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, Mena 2007).  The parasites <em>Eimeria nutalli</em>, <em>Placoconus lotoris</em>, <em>Capillaria procyonis</em>, a&#160;<em>Physaloptera</em> sp., a mite in the family Listrophoridae, and a trematode in the family Heterophyidae have been collected from <em>P. pygmaeus&#160;</em>(McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005).  The identification of <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> in some Pygmy Raccoons suggests a recent spillover from domestic cats (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Pygmy Raccoon has been exposed to infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper and feline panleukopenia viruses (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  <br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoons share the same mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, suggesting a recent population bottleneck that might be related to a founder effect (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2008).",

Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera <em>et al</em>. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.<br/><br/>The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).<br/><br/>Alien invasive predators, such as the&#160;snake&#160;<em>Boa constrictor</em>, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon&#160;<em>P. lotor</em> (there are&#160;frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland),&#160;usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg <em>et al</em>. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.<br/><br/>Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat."

The reintroduced animals and their progeny in north-eastern North Carolina are considered members of an experimental non-essential population. This designation was promulgated under Section 10(j) of the ESA and permits the USFWS to manage the population and promote recovery in a manner that is respectful of the needs and concerns of local citizens (Parker and Phillips 1991). Hunting of Red Wolves is prohibited by the ESA. To date, federal protection of the Red Wolf has been adequate to successfully reintroduce and promote recovery of the species in North Carolina.<br/><br/>A very active recovery programme for the Red Wolf has been in existence since the mid-1970s (USFWS 1990; Phillips et al. 2003), with some measures from as early as the mid-1960s (USFWS, unpubl.). By 1976, a captive breeding programme was established using 17 animals captured in Texas and Louisiana (Carley 1975; USFWS 1990). Of these, 14 became the founders of the current captive breeding programme. In 1977, the first pups were born in the captive programme, and by 1985, the captive population had grown to 65 individuals in six zoological facilities (Parker 1986). As of 2017 there were approximately 175 Red Wolves in captivity at 43 facilities throughout the United States and Canada (USFWS, unpubl.). The purpose of the captive population is to safeguard the genetic integrity of the species and to provide animals for reintroduction.&#160;<br/><br/>With the species reasonably secure in captivity, the USFWS began reintroducing Red Wolves at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in north-eastern North Carolina in 1987. As of September 2002, 102 animals have been released with a minimum of 281 descendants produced in the wild since 1987. By 2005, the population had grown to include more than 150 wolves distributed across nearly 6,000 km² of private land (~ 70%) and public land (~30%). The public land included three national wildlife refuges (Alligator River NWR, Pocosin Lakes NWR, and Mattamuskeet NWR) which provided important protection to the wolves. Notably, the USFWS also estimated that over a dozen hybrid canids were also present in north-eastern North Carolina.&#160;<br/><br/>However, by about 2012 the reintroduction project had become mired in significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) that led to a substantial increase in illegal killing of wolves. In response to these characterizations, starting in 2016 the USWFS began taking steps to significantly change the direction of the Red Wolf recovery programme. By 2016 and 2017, changes being cemented into action included: 1) improving the foundation of the captive breeding programme to ensure that the species did not go extinct; 2) restricting free-ranging Red Wolves to about 800 km² of federal lands in mainland Dare County, North Carolina, an area that can support no more than 20 or 30 such animals; 3) returning all Red Wolves found elsewhere in north-eastern North Carolina to captivity to assist with #1 or providing such animals with little or no federal protection; and 4) assessing potential sites throughout the south-eastern United States for future reintroduction projects. Absent successful reintroductions that result in the restoration of several hundred red wolves (at one or a few sites), recovery of the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act will not be possible.<br/><br/>During 1991, a second reintroduction project was initiated at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (Lucash <em>et al</em>. 1999). Thirty-seven Red Wolves were released from 1992 to 1998. Of these, 26 either died or were recaptured after straying onto private lands outside the Park (Henry 1998). Moreover, only five of the 32 pups known to have been born in the wild survived, but were removed from the wild during their first year (USFWS, unpubl.). Biologists suspect that disease, predation, malnutrition, and parasites contributed to the high rate of pup mortality (USFWS, unpubl.). Primarily because of the poor survival of wild-born offspring, the USFWS terminated the Tennessee restoration effort in 1998 (Henry 1998).",

Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-west Louisiana and south-east Texas (Carley 1975; Shaw 1975). However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the south-east (Paradiso and Nowak 1971, 1972; Riley and McBride 1972). Red Wolves reintroduced into north-eastern North Carolina and their descendants have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins. Pocosins are forest/wetland mosaics characterized by an overstory of loblolly and pond pine (<em>Pinus taeda</em> and <em>Pinus serotina</em>, respectively) and an understory of evergreen shrubs (Christensen <em>et al.</em> 1981). This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. The findings of Hahn (2002) seem to support this generalization in that low human density, wetland soil type, and distance from roads were the most important predictor of potential wolf habitat in eastern North Carolina.",

Indeed, north-eastern North Carolina was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes (Parker 1986). However, during the 1990s, the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area (P. Sumner pers. comm.; USFWS, unpubl.). From the start of the reintroduction project in 1987 through to about 2005, the Red Wolf population grew to more than 150 animals. Intensive management was useful at minimizing the extent of hybridization with Coyotes and Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids (Gese and Terletzky 2015, Gese <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, by about 2012, the reintroduction project had become notably characterized by significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) which led to a substantial increase in the illegal killing of Red Wolves."

Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that prohibited harvest of all marine turtle species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990).  In 2000, the new National Program for Protection, conservationmeasures, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,  proposed strategies and actions for the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that nest in Mexico.<br/><br/>In 1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and expanded their use to the Pacific in 1997. Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority.  The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In 1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females, their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>Today, general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests. When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling. Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em> nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests, they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Since 1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some equipment.<br/><br/>FWS, Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island beginning in 2000.<br/><br/>Educational programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999). Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the mid-2000s. &#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2. United States</em><br/>Development of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state law in 1987. &#160; From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since 1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000). <br/><br/>In addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure through the Shrimp conservationmeasures Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001). The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting period. Several rules were adopted in the early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles, particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening or July 15. <br/><br/>Other gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. The State of Georgia requires the use of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160; Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states and in Federal waters.&#160; Several regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5 cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat, is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment. Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration and development occur at PAIS. The NPS and FWS work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle. Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict measures. Patrols are conducted at PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>",

Nesting is primarily restricted to the western Gulf of Mexico, ranging from Texas, United States, to Veracruz, Mexico, with the majority of nesting occurring on an approximate 30 km stretch of the primary nesting beach with an epicenter located near Playa de Rancho Nuevo, in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994, Pritchard 2007, NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011, Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2016b).</p>",

Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie <em>et al</em>. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013; Shaver <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale <em>et al</em>. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‘oceanic’) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington <em>et al.</em> 2012, Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013, McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017). These areas of the GoM and Atlantic represent important developmental and foraging habitat for both oceanic and neritic life history stages of the Kemp's Ridley. &#160;&#160;For further information on Kemp's Ridley habitat use and ecology, see reviews in NMFS <em>et al</em>.

                            rationale = "<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g. incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947 Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data&#160;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">(<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3% reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e. estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information). Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80% decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80% (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season), and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since 1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on 30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least Concern<br/></em>population of mature individuals (adult males and females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>",

Ferret habitat selection at fine scales is dependent on density of prairie-dog burrow openings (Eads&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013).&#160;It has been estimated that about 40-60 hectares of prairie-dog colony are needed to support one Black-footed Ferret.

Multiple techniques and approaches are currently being developed and tested to reduce direct and indirect threats caused by plague.<br/><br/>Populations of Black-footed Ferrets declined throughout the 20th century to near extinction by the late 1970s (Biggins and Schroeder 1988). A small remnant population (around 100 animals or fewer; Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) was discovered in 1981 near Meeteetse, in northwestern Wyoming, but that population was decimated by canine distemper and plague&#160;in 1985 (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 1988).<br/><br/>Another major threat is the loss of habitat by conversion of grasslands to agricultural uses; the remaining habitat is now fragmented by great expanses of cropland and human development.

It appears to be effectively extirpated in the eastern North Atlantic but in the past probably ranged from a calving ground in the Golfo de Cintra (23°N) off Western Sahara, through the Azores, Bay of Biscay, western British Isles, and the Norwegian Sea to the North Cape (hence the Dutch name Noordkaper). In the western North Atlantic the species migrates from a calving ground off Florida and Georgia along the eastern seaboard of North America, to summering grounds in the Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Saint Lawrence. <p></p><p>Today, North Atlantic Right Whales are regularly surveyed in the winter calving ground off Florida and Georgia, and in spring/summer feeding grounds in Cape Cod Bay, the Great South Channel off Massachusetts, the Gulf of Maine, the Scotian Shelf, the Bay of Fundy, and increasingly in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, but not all the whales using the wintering ground are seen in these major summering areas (IWC 2001a). There have been a few sightings off Cape Farewell (southern tip of Greenland) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2007) and Iceland (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the Gulf of Mexico (Ward-Geiger <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p> <p></p><p>There have been very few sightings in the northeast Atlantic in recent times.

A survey of the former Cintra Bay calving ground off Western Sahara failed to locate any Right Whales (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 1998). A sighting off Norway in 1999 was identified as an animal from the western North Atlantic population (Jacobsen <em>et al.</em> 2004).

                            habitat = "Right Whales feed on calanoid copepods and other small invertebrates (smaller copepods, euphausids (krill), pteropods, and larval barnacles), generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the surface. The most common prey species is the copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus </em>(Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. 2007). <p>Relative abundance of Right Whales has been positively correlated with copepod density off the northeastern coast of the United States (Pendleton <em>et al.</em> 2009), and also correlated with sea surface temperature, sediment type, and bathymetry (Good 2008). Baumgartner and Mate (2005) attached satellite-monitored radio tags to Right Whales in the Bay of Fundy in order to investigate their habitat use. They found that when the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundances of <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> are thought to be high. Instead, the whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification. No evidence was found that the tagged Right Whales associated with oceanic fronts or regions with high standing stocks of phytoplankton.</p> Good (2008) investigated the relationship between Right Whale distribution and physical oceanographic conditions in an attempt to create predictive models of essential habitat for the species. The model correctly identified well documented current and historical calving grounds in the eastern North Atlantic, and suggested that suitable calving habitat on the east coast of the United States may extend farther north than is currently recognized. In the Gulf of Maine, Right Whale distribution was correlated primarily with sea surface temperature, sediment type and bathymetry. The predictive models employed by Good (2008) offered insights into habitat preferences for foraging but failed to wholly capture the physical factors underlying Right Whale distribution.",
                            population = "<strong>Current status</strong><br/><br/><em>Northwestern Atlantic<br/></em>Based mainly on photo-identification data, the North Atlantic Right Whale population was estimated to have been increasing at an average rate of 2.8% per year from 1990 to 2010, peaking at about 480 individuals in 2010. Abundance declined slightly from 2010 to 2015, following a run of years of below average reproduction which is reflected in both lower calf counts and longer calving intervals (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017). The best recent estimate is 468 animals (95% credible interval 444-471) in 2015. Associated with a lower estimated survival rate for females, the female proportion in the population is estimated to be only about 40%, despite a birth sex ratio close to 50:50. The abundance will have declined further in 2017 given 17 documented deaths (including 12 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada, and five in northeastern U.S. waters), in 2017 or nearly 4% of the population (NOAA Fisheries 2018).<br/><br/>There has also been a change since 2011 in the Atlantic Right Whales' patterns of habitat use (IWC 2017). There may have been a northward shift in summer distribution into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, leaving fewer whales in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine (Stokstad 2017) but increased observations in the Gulf may also have been due to an increase in observer effort that has not been quantified across the years (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The rate of increase of North Atlantic Right Whales compares unfavourably with that of Southern Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). While known cases of human-caused mortality (entanglements and ship strikes) up to 2016 averaged only about 1% of the population annually (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), entanglement-caused deaths probably exceed the known cases because death is not always immediate. An analysis of individuals observed to be entangled in fishing gear between 1995 and 2008 showed approximately 25% lower survival rates than whales not seen to be carrying gear (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2015). The occurrence of skin lesions of a kind not seen in Southern Right Whales was recorded in North Atlantic Right Whales during the period 1995 to 2002, and appeared to be correlated with the failure to reproduce of females that would normally have been ready to calve (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Over the same period, body condition as measured by blubber thickness was poorer in the North Atlantic whales than in Southern Right Whales (IWC 2001b).<br/><br/>Calf counts have been conducted since 1980, and calf production has fluctuated. It was particularly low during 1998-2000 and again during 2010-2017 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Years of low calf production have been correlated with environmental conditions (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2003) and with poor body condition of adults (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). Based on the pattern of occurrence on the calving ground of females at different stages in the calving cycle, Browning et al. (2010) were able to infer that there is considerable cryptic perinatal mortality in addition to known calf deaths. For the period 1989-2003, they documented 191 surviving calves and 17 known calf deaths and estimated a further 28 cryptic calf deaths. The mean interval between successful calvings appears to be longer for North Atlantic Right Whales than for Southern Right Whales (Browning et al. 2010) although the published estimates are not fully comparable.<br/><br/><em>Northeastern Atlantic</em><br/>Due to the paucity of records in recent times (see the Geographic Range section), and the fact that at least some of the records are migrants from the west, it is not clear whether there is a remnant northeastern Atlantic breeding population. It is also unclear whether in the past the animals in the northern part of the range (off Iceland and Norway) belonged mainly to the western or eastern breeding populations, or to what degree the two breeding populations were separate.<br/><br/><em>Historical population size</em><br/>The first records of Basque whaling in the Bay of Biscay are from the 11th century. At least dozens of Right Whales were taken each year in the Bay of Biscay until a marked decline was evident by 1650, and whaling declined during the 18th century. Basque whalers arrived in Iceland as early as 1412, and participated in the Right Whale fishery around the British Isles and Norway from the 14th to the 18th century, but probably many more whales were taken by Dutch, Danish, British, and Norwegian whalers. Quantitative estimates of catches are not available. Historic Right Whale catches as far north as Iceland and Norway appear to have been mainly <em>E. glacialis</em>, with Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) being the main species only in the far north (Greenland and Svalbard) (Aguilar 1986). Smith <em>et al</em>. (2006) documented extensive whaling for Right Whales in the North Cape area (northern Norway) in the 17th century. Right Whale hunting in the northeastern Atlantic seems to have declined from the mid-17th century and all but disappeared by the mid-18th century, but there was a brief period of Right Whale catches by modern whalers operating from shore stations in the northwestern British Isles and off Iceland, with at least 120 Right Whales taken during 1881-1924 (Collett 1909, Brown 1986). The last recorded catch was a cow-calf pair off Madeira in 1967, accompanied by a third individual that escaped.<br/><br/>It is not clear when Basque whaling first spread to the northwestern North Atlantic, but it had been established no later than 1530. It had long been thought that large numbers (tens of thousands) of Right Whales were taken off Labrador and Newfoundland by the Basques between 1530 and 1610 (Aguilar 1986, Reeves 2001) but recent genetic evidence suggest that many if not most of these were Bowheads (Rastogi <em>et al</em>. 2004, McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2008). Shore-based whaling along the U.S. east coast began in the mid 17th century and continued at least sporadically over the next two and a half centuries (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Historical catches, particularly in the northeastern Atlantic, are insufficiently documented to allow estimation of the pre-whaling population size. Monsarrat <em>et al</em>. (2016) used historical catches in the North Pacific, which are better documented, to relate pre-whaling Right Whale summer abundance to habitat parameters, and then applied this relationship to the North Atlantic. This resulted in an estimated pre-whaling total abundance in the North Atlantic of 9,000-21,000, based on ecological carrying capacity. Much of this population is predicted to have summered in the Norwegian Sea and on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.<br/><br/>The historical population reductions occurred more than three generations ago, hence they do not trigger the Red List population reduction criteria (A).",

Using the lower 95% credible interval of the estimate (444) results in an estimate of 258 mature individuals. Given the evidence that the population has been declining since 2010, the mortality event in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, in 2017 which will have accelerated the decline, and the low proportion of females in the population (about 40%), a classification as Endangered under IUCN Red List criterion D remains appropriate at this time.

During 2010-2014, there were 29 confirmed human-caused deaths or serious injuries, including 24 entanglements and five ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Because some anthropogenic deaths probably pass undetected, the reported events are considered minima. Entanglement events appear to be increasing in both frequency and severity (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><p>An examination of photo-identification photographs revealed that most individual Right Whales (82.9%) possess evidence of being entangled at least once while over half (59.0%) of the individuals have been entangled more than once. The evidence suggests that Right Whales acquire new entanglement scars on an annual basis, juvenile whales at a higher rate than adults (Knowlton<em> et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement events that are initially sublethal probably also result in excess mortality over time. Based on observations during 1995-2008 of 50 free-living individuals observed to be carrying fishing gear, compared with 459 individuals never seen with gear during that period, Robbins <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated an excess mortality of approximately 25% during the first year after which the individual was first seen with gear. Because some fatalities may occur before the whale is seen with gear, this provides a minimum estimate of the fatality rate of entangled whales in addition to the immediate fatalities. &#160; <br/></p> <p><em></em></p>In the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (Canada), groundfish hook-and-line gear had been found to pose the greatest risk to Right Whales during the summer, and lobster fisheries during the spring and autumn migration periods (Vanderlaan <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, of 12 right whale deaths recorded in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in summer 2017, 6 could be examined, and the cause of death was found to be entanglement in snow crab fishing gear in 2 cases and suspected to be blunt trauma consistent with vessel strike in 4 cases. In addition, five live whales were found entangled including at least four in snow crab gear. Three of those whales were freed by human intervention or freed themselves, and the fate of the remaining two is unknown (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017, Taylor and Walker 2017).<br/><p>Right Whales appear to be the most vulnerable large whales to ship strikes (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2007). Ship strikes were found to be the cause of death for 53% of the 40 Right Whales necropsied between 1970 and 2006 and could be responsible for up to 10 individual Right Whale deaths per year (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2009). Known Right Whale deaths due to ship strikes have declined from 2.0 (2000–2006) to 1.0 per year (2010–2014) (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The decrease may be due, in part, to spatial mitigation efforts (so-called Seasonal Management Areas, or SMAs) implemented in U.S. waters in 2008 (Hoop <em>et al. </em>2015). The SMAs were designed to correspond to Right Whale feeding, calving, and migration areas and it is estimated that this mitigation effort reduced mortality by 80-90% (Conn and Silber 2013). The risk of ship strike was reduced by an estimated 82% due to an “Area to Be Avoided” vessel-routing initiative implemented by the International Maritime Organization in the Roseway Basin Area on the Scotian Shelf (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2009).<br/> </p><p>Low-frequency in-water noise from shipping activity has been linked to physiological stress (increased glucocorticoid levels) in North Atlantic Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al.</em> 2012). Acoustic masking from anthropogenic noise (especially ship noise) may negatively impact reproduction by interfering with courtship vocalizations and may negatively impact prey acquisition by reducing communication and feeding opportunities (Hatch <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/></p><p>Environmental neurotoxins produced as a result of harmful algal blooms have the potential to cause negative effects on reproduction and development. Paralytic shellfish toxin and domoic acid that were detected in fecal samples indicate that Right Whales are exposed to environmental neurotoxins on an annual basis for up to six months of the year (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2002, Doucette <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>No population-level increase in mortality rates had been detected up to 2015, and the estimated population decline during 2010-15 appears to have been due to poor reproduction (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017). The reduced reproduction may have been related to the apparent decline in average body condition (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016) which may in turn be related to some of the influences discussed above. The high number of deaths recorded in 2017, at nearly 4% of the population size, will have accelerated the population decline.<br/></p> <p></p> <p></p>"

This compares with 25.2 birds/km<sup>2</sup> reported in the 1970s (Castro 1976)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Based on field surveys and ecological niche models generated with MaxEnt models, the species has&#160;lost potentially 57% of their former historical distribution, although records for the species were obtained from Nuevo León, Veracruz, where it it had previously been thought to have disappeared (Monterrubio-Rico 2012; Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al. in press</em>).

Clutches of 2-5 eggs are incubated for 25-31 days (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

It possibly extends into northern Costa Rica, although the true distribution of this species is unknown. Specimens examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from Managua, Nicaragua.<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis</em> is definitely known only from the western (Veraguas) side of the forested mountains of the Azuero peninsula in the vicinity of Ponuga, where it appears to be isolated. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) indicated that it may occur to the west along the Pacific coast to the Burica Peninsula, near the Panama-Costa Rica border. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) tentatively attributed a series of skulls 25 skulls from the collection of Adolph H. Schultz (no skins, but reported to have been light coloured) from Río La Vaca, near Puerto Armmuelles, Burica Peninsula to <em>A. g. azuerensis</em>. Baldwin and Baldwin (1976) found no evidence that spider monkeys ever occurred in the Province of Chiriquí. Konstant <em>et al</em>. (1985) reported that the Azuero Pensinula was widely deforested and that subspecies is likely to be surviving only in western parts. <br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi frontatus</em> is believed to range through northwestern Costa Rica and extreme western and northern Nicaragua (Kellogg and Goldman 1944). Specimens from Nicaragua examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from the following localities: Lavala; Peña Blanca; Río Siquia; Río Yoya, a tributary of the Río Princapolca; Tuma and Uluce. Allen (1908, 1910) recorded <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>from the east slope of the Nicaraguan highlands, Savala (800 ft), Tuma (1,000 ft), Peña Blanca (high point in low Atlantic coast forests, 1,500 ft) and Uluce (about 1,000 ft), and in the highlands of northern Nicaragua at Matagalpa (2,000 ft).<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi grisescens</em> is a subspecies of doubtful validity. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) presumed that it occurred in the valley of the Río Tuyra and probably south-eastward through the Serranía del Sapo of extreme south-eastern Panama and the Cordillera de Baudó of north-western Colombia. Matamoros and Seal (2001) indicate its occurrence in the basin of the lower Río Tuira in Panama and the frontier zone with Colombia. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) indicated Cerro Pirre or Río Tucutí as marking the limits of its range with <em>A. f. rufiventris </em>to the north. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) indicated that <em>grisescens</em> occurs in Colombia: “…[it] is known only from the vicinity of Juradó very near the Panamanian border on the Pacific coast. It is undoubtedly restricted by the Baudó Mountains to a narrow coastal strip that may extend as far south as Cabo Corrientes.” (p.66). Defler <em>et al</em>. (2003) recorded that there is no recent information regarding its presence or otherwise along the Panamanian border, but that colonists near the northern parts of the Serranía de Baudó region talk of two “types” of <em>Ateles</em>, one in the lowlands (definitely <em>A. fusciceps</em>) and another form above 500–600 m altitude (J. V. Rodríguez-M. unpubl.), the only real suggestion that this taxon might actually be present in Colombia. <em>A. fusciceps</em> in the central part of the Sierra de Baudó would indicate that the occurrence of <em>grisescens</em> therefore would be limited to the portion immediately abutting Panama, and not the entire mountain range (Defler <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi ornatus</em> is found in forested regions of Panama, east of the Canal Zone (Cordillera San Blas), and west through Chiriquí to central western Costa Rica. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) give the following localities as marking the eastern limit of its range: San Juan, Cerro Brujo, Cerro Azul and Río Pequeñi—all on or within the boundary line of the Madden Lake watershed, and nowhere more than 30 miles east of the Panama Canal. The Río Bayano basin just to the east is occupied by <em>A. fusciceps rufiventris</em> (see Handley 1966; Heltne and Kunkel 1975). This is the spider monkey of the Osa Peninsula, Corcovado National Park and Carara Biological Reserve in Costa Rica (Matamoros and Seal 2001). The population on the Island of Barro Colorado is introduced (Carpenter 1935; J. F. Eisenberg pers. comm. in Konstant <em>et al</em>. 1985). Crockett <em>et al</em>. (1997; see also Cody 1994; Querol <em>et al</em>. 1996) observed spider monkeys in the Refugio Bartola / Reserva Indio-Maíz (300,000 ha), along the Río Bartola, north of the Río San Juan along the frontier with Costa Rica. They were unable to identify the subspecies but said that, unlike <em>A. g. geoffroyi</em>, they were “distinctly reddish on the back and on the top of the tail; the ends of the limbs were dark” (p.73). <br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus</em> occurs in the forests of Veracruz and eastern San Luis Potosí and south-eastward through Tabasco, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in eastern Oaxaca, including the highlands of Guatemala (thought by Kellogg and Goldman [1944] to have been occupied by <em>A. g. pan</em>, here considered a synonym) through El Salvador and Honduras, including the north coast to the lowlands of the Mosquitia in the Department of Gracias a Dios.<br/><br/><em>Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis</em> occurs in the forests of the Yucatán peninsula, north-eastern Guatemala, and adjoining parts of Belize, intergrading to the south in Mexico (Campeche) and Guatemela with <em>vellerosus</em>. Parra Lara and Jorgenson (1998) reported on a survey of 36 localities in the state of Quintana Roo. They confirmed the presence of spider monkeys in 11 of them, and received reports of their occurrence in a further 19, extending from the Ejido Tres Garantias in the south to locations way in the north, near Cancún, at Cenote Notnozot. Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco (2003) have studied the population size and habitat use of <em>A. g. yucatanensis</em> around the Punta Laguna, Quintana Roo.",
                            habitat = "Occurs in primary lowland rain forest, evergreen and semideciduous, and will enter deciduous forest (Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica: Freese 1976; Ortiz-Martínez and Rico-Gray 2007)<br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus </em>was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (most usually 2-4), the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group sizes of <em>A. geoffroyi</em> can range from 16-24 (Di Fiore and Campbell 2007). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a “core area” of the group’s home range which she uses most. Klein and Klein (1976, 1977) estimated 259-388 ha ranges with 20-30% overlap for <em>A. belzebuth</em> in La Macarena National Park, Colombia. <em>Ateles</em> are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees.<br/><br/>Freese (1976) recorded high numbers of infants in the dry season (December-May) in the Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976; see also Milton 1981; Chapman and Chapman 1990). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Adult male weight 7.42-9.00 kg (mean 8.26 kg, n=56), adult female weight 6.0-9.4 kg (mean 7.7 kg, n = &gt;100) (Ford and Davis 1992).",

Coelho <em>et al.</em> (1976) estimated a higher density of 45 individuals/km². Populaions of this species can be very high in well prtoected areas: Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco, 2003) recorded 89.5 individuals/km² in what they refer to as \"relatively undisturbed semi-evergreen medium forest [as opposed to successional forest] with trees up to 20 m in height\" at Punta Laguna, Quintana Roo.
