A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding and reintroduction programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park is preventing extinction in the wild. The success of the scheme has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to an annual hatch of 25-30 birds in recent years (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. The genetic diversity of the population has been maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. \"Aversion training\" to avoid powerlines and humans is practised (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>. A total of 154 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2003 (Wallace 2004)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to help prevent lead-poisoning, and community education programmes aim to minimise persecution (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong>. However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than before and are less likely to take the food provided for them (Bakker <em>et al. </em>2017). A huge step has been taken towards eliminating the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, which requires the use of non-lead ammunition within the species's range in California and was implemented in 2008. As of February 2009, 99% of hunters were compliant with the act. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is now distributing safer lead-substitute bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors; similar programmes are being initiated in California (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and Utah. Public awareness and engagement are continuing to increase, working toward the elimination of lead ammunition and the removal of lead-tainted carcasses from the field (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). By 2019, a California-wide ban of lead ammunition is scheduled to go into effect (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity measures include a website and near-weekly condor articles in local newspapers (D. Cooper and J. Grantham<em> in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. Legislation coming into force in early 2010 made it illegal for persons to enter a U.S. national park with a loaded firearm (Toops 2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends. Continue the recovery plan to achieve two disjunct, self-sustaining populations of 150 individuals comprising 15 breeding pairs. Identify further potential release sites in southern New Mexico (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong>. Resume release programme in Mexico and establish new release sites in northern California. Maintain and increase the productivity of the captive population. Continue releases of captive-bred birds<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Maintain suitable habitat (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Continue supplemental feeding (Walters <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2010).

Continue supplying alternative lead-free ammunition to deer hunters. Advocate strongly for a ban on lead ammunition and lobby the Fish and Game Commission to ensure legislation is passed. Encourage the USFWS to promote the elimination of lead ammunition on land administered by other government agencies. Promote parent rearing of offspring (Walters <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2010).<br/><p></p>",

Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002, and by February 2009 56 nesting attempts had been recorded, from which at least 19 chicks have fledged and survived (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. In December 2003, birds were released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California, where one pair were observed raising chicks in 2009 (Moir 2009)<strong></strong>. Releases in New Mexico have been abandoned due to lack of funding, and release priorities have shifted to identifying sites and partnerships in southern Sierra Nevada, California (Chu <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although one individual wandered north to Flaming Gorge (Wyoming) and localities in Colorado before returning to the Grand Canyon area. The California birds occur regularly in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, and probably Santa Cruz counties. By December 2006, there were 130 wild birds at five release sites (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006, <strong></strong>Graham 2006)<strong></strong>, including at least 44 that were over six years old, the earliest age at which the species breeds (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and in February 2012, the total population stood at 173 individuals in captivity and 213 in the wild, primarily in southern and central California (Carpentier 2009, C. N. Parish <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. In January 2010, the number of released birds that had produced viable offspring stood at 44, with another 60 birds of breeding age (J. Grantham <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. By 2017, the total population has increased to 446 birds (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). The Arizona/Utah population now numbers 78 birds, with four birds released in 2017 and another 10 earmarked for release in 2018 (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). <br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, <strong>Mexico</strong> in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick born in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where efforts are ongoing to increase the population to an anticipated carrying capacity of c.20 pairs (Wallace 2005)<strong></strong>. It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. 2015 was an important year for the species in terms of its recovery in the wild as it was the first year when the number of individuals that died in the wild was less than the number of juveniles that fledged (Silber 2016). Second generation birds have recently matured to breeding age, but no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (C. Battistone <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<p></p>",

Released birds have become increasingly independent in finding food and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers <em>et al. </em>2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.<p></p>",

N. Parish <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat for released birds (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007, Walters <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2010)<strong></strong>; 9 of 13 birds released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California had to be recaptured and tested for lead poisoning after feasting on a field of squirrel carcasses shot by hunters using lead-shot in 2006. It is particularly prone to the threat of lead-poisoning owing to its longevity and delayed-onset breeding strategy, and given the distances it travels to forage, meaning lead can build up in the blood to dangerous levels over many years having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2007)<strong></strong>. Shooting and accidental poisoning continue to be the principal threats to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007)<strong></strong>, but lead ammunition is being banned within the species's range in California and there are increasing indications that the federal government will gradually phase out the use of lead across the U.S. Despite efforts to reduce the threat of lead-poisoning, it is reported that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009)<strong></strong> and in January 2010 three birds were found to have died from lead-poisoning in northern Arizona. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors in the region are experiencing toxicological effects from lead ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). In preparation of a potential release at new sites in northern California, a study found that Common Ravens <em>Corvus corax</em>&#160;and Turkey Vultures <em>Cathartes aura</em>&#160;in the region still suffered from high lead contamination (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity and awareness raising campaigns appear to have successfully reduced persecution.&#160;<br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of the breakdown compounds of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to this population, it is thought that this is linked to feeding on the carcasses of predatory marine mammals that had been exposed to the pesticide from a specific point source during their lifetimes (Burnett<em> et al. </em>2013, Kurle <em>et al. </em>2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is a further significant impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in this population. Ingested anthropogenic material was recently responsible for the deaths of two nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other deaths<strong></strong>. The dead condors were found to have swallowed glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc. (Mee <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007)<strong></strong>. Two birds were shot in California in 2009. Both were alive as of April 2009, both being treated for lead poisoning (Anon. 2009)<strong></strong>. Puppet-reared birds may be more prone to exhibit problematic human-oriented behaviour such as tameness and vandalising property than parent-reared birds (Meretsky <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines, but this behavioural problem has been addressed using a conditioning programme with fake power poles (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. The spread of west Nile virus is not anticipated to be a problem for the species as most birds are vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. Overall survival of released birds has been high, although without the capture, treatment and re-release of lead contaminated birds it is likely that rates of mortality in the wild still exceed sustainable levels (Walters <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2010, L.

In a study covering a span of six years (from 1998 to 2004), axolotl density had reduced from 0.006-org/ m2 to 0.001-org/ m2, although it is thought that this reduction could also be due to its own population dynamics (Zambrano 2006). A recent scientific survey revealed no axolotls, although wild-caught animals are still found in the local market, which indicates that fishermen still know where to find them. There has not been a density study of the Chalco population, but evidence suggests that the population there is small and, furthermore, Chalco is a highly unstable system that runs the risk of disappearing in the near future.",

The harvesting is targeted at animals that are less than one year old. It was formerly also captured for the international pet trade, although probably all animals in the international trade are now of captive origin. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality. Although the water regime has changed in the last 10 years, and it is reported that pollution levels are decreasing, factors such as very high levels of bacterial contamination could still pose a serious threat."

Subalpine herbaceous communities with steep slopes support the largest populations (Nagorsen 1987). Common tree species in these communities are <em>Abies lasiocarpa</em>, <em>Tsuga mertensiana</em>, and <em>Chamaecyparis nootkatensis</em>; shrubs and herbs include <em>Vaccinium</em> spp., <em>Luetkea pectinata</em>, <em>Alnus sinuata</em>, <em>Erigeron peregrinus</em>, <em>Rhododendron albiflorum</em>, <em>Phlox diffusa</em>, <em>Anaphalis margaritacea</em>, <em>Aster foliaceus</em>, <em>Lupinus arcticus</em>, and <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em> (Milko 1984). Preferred lush forb/grass meadows are relatively rare on Vancouver Island; they generally are restricted to steep, south-facing slopes where avalanches and snow creep inhibit the growth of trees (Nagorsen 1987). Fire also creates favourable meadow habitat on subalpine slopes. Most marmot occurrences are on south- and west-facing slopes (Bryant and Janz 1996). Colonies have also been found in coniferous forest, logging clearcut slash, road banks, and cleared ski runs. In fact, half of the world's <em>M. vancouverensis</em> were living in clearcuts in 1997, compared to about 25% in the mid-1980s and none prior to high elevation logging that began in the late 1960s. Individual marmots occasionally take up residence in valley-bottom gardens (Munro 1985).<br/><br/>Marmots prefer areas with sufficient soil for burrowing, and with large rocks or stumps for burrowing under and for lookout sites. Burrows are usually below rocks in or near meadows. Young are born in underground burrows.&#160;<em>M. vancouverensis</em> is colonial. Colonies are relatively small and inhabit small habitat patches. Most are made up of one to three family units, and the average size before the young-of-the-year emerge is about eight individuals (Bryant 1990). Meta-populations of this species consist of a patchwork of colonies, each of which experiences periodic extinctions and recolonizations (Bryant and Janz 1996). Dispersal is a key ingredient of this pattern; the appearance of individual marmots in unusual habitats far from known colonies indicates that&#160;<em>M. vancouverensis</em> is capable of extensive dispersal through forested lands (Munro 1985). Year-to-year persistence of family groups has been measured at 43% in natural sites and at 13% in logging slash sites (Bryant 1990). Most mortality apparently occurs during hibernation. Survivorship varied dramatically from year to year in Bryant's (1990) study, but a small sample size prevented any accurate determination of a mean rate. Predation on <em>M. vancouverensis</em> has not been studied, but potential predators include <em>Canis lupus, Martes americana, Gulo gulo, Felis concolor, Ursus americanus, Buteo jamaicensis, Aquila chrysaetos, Accipiter gentilis</em>, and <em>Bubo virginianus</em> (Bryant 1990).&#160;Grasses and sedges are the most important food in early spring; forbs make up the bulk of the summer diet. Small fruits are also eaten. Hibernates from early October to early May.<br/><br/>There appears to be sufficient habitat for Vancouver Island Marmots, however the distribution of habitat relative to dispersal may make some habitat relatively inaccessible to active Marmot colonies.",

Conservative estimates are 140-190 marmot in the wild, based on field counts. Bryant (2005) reported the following: \"Population counts began in 1979 and have continued, with variable coverage and intensity, until the present. Marmots expanded into new habitats created by clearcut logging of high-elevation primary forests during the 1980s; numbers increased to an estimated 300-350 individuals by 1986, with about half of these living in clearcuts (Bryant and Janz 1996). The temporary population expansion was followed by precipitous decline and near-extinction in the wild (Bryant 2000). Fewer than 130 marmots were known to be alive by 2004, including 93 in captivity and about 35 in the wild (unpublished minutes, Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, November 2004).\"&#160;In 2007 it was estimated that there were only about 85 individuals remaining in the wild with about 162 individuals remaining in captivity (Kruckenhauser <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since 2000, 579 pups (45% female) have been weaned in the captive population, 43 marmots reside between the Calgary and Toronto Zoos. Release of captive bred marmots begin in 2003 and from 2003-2016 there have been 490 captive marmots released into suitable habitat (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 100 marmots released are monitored using transmitters each year.&#160;<br/><br/>Since 1972, the species has been found at 47 sites on 15 mountains (Bryant and Janz 1996). However, only four occurrences are known to be extant.<br/><br/>Population trends are difficult to determine because estimates of numbers and sizes of colonies before the 1970s are not available and only one or two relatively thorough censuses have been done (these only in the central part of the range). Numbers of adults were above average during the early 1980s and were reported as near or below average since 1990 by Bryant and Janz (1996). Recent data indicate a significant decline during the 1990s. Data for 1997 indicated a 60% decline in numbers during the past decade and a similar reduction in geographic range in the last several decades (Bryant <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>A thorough and systematic inventory of all of Vancouver Island, especially the western and northern mountains, is needed to determine the actual present status.",

Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as \"sinks\" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of <em>M. vancouverensis</em> is not viable using existing criteria.<br/><br/>Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality.

Pygmy Raccoon prefers mangrove stands and sandy areas, but it is&#160;also found in semi-evergreen and sub-deciduous tropical forests and agricultural areas. Abundance varies considerable across&#160;vegetation types. Most of the population lives in the&#160;coastal areas of the island, and a large proportion of the central part of the island is&#160;uninhabited or has only a&#160;very low density. Pygmy Raccoon may inhabit areas near human settlements, and/or paved and unpaved roads (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoon is mainly nocturnal, although it is not uncommon to see it during daylight (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005).  Generally it is solitary, but sometimes forms&#160;family groups (Jones and Lawlor 1965,&#160;Cuarón&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). McFadden and Meiri (2013) concluded that dwarfism in the Pygmy Raccoon may be an insular adaptation to the fewer resources found on Cozumel Island compared with the mainland.<br/><br/>It is omnivorous, with a preference for crabs followed by fruits, insects, crayfish, and small vertebrates (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006). The relevance of the different food items varies strongly&#160;between seasons and sites, and following major changes in habitat quality because of hurricanes (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The Pygmy Raccoon is particularly vulnerable to introduced pathogens and diseases such as mange, rabies and dog distemper from exotic animals (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, Mena 2007).  The parasites <em>Eimeria nutalli</em>, <em>Placoconus lotoris</em>, <em>Capillaria procyonis</em>, a&#160;<em>Physaloptera</em> sp., a mite in the family Listrophoridae, and a trematode in the family Heterophyidae have been collected from <em>P. pygmaeus&#160;</em>(McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005).  The identification of <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> in some Pygmy Raccoons suggests a recent spillover from domestic cats (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Pygmy Raccoon has been exposed to infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper and feline panleukopenia viruses (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  <br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoons share the same mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, suggesting a recent population bottleneck that might be related to a founder effect (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2008).",

Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera <em>et al</em>. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.<br/><br/>The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).<br/><br/>Alien invasive predators, such as the&#160;snake&#160;<em>Boa constrictor</em>, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon&#160;<em>P. lotor</em> (there are&#160;frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland),&#160;usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg <em>et al</em>. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.<br/><br/>Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat."

The reintroduced animals and their progeny in north-eastern North Carolina are considered members of an experimental non-essential population. This designation was promulgated under Section 10(j) of the ESA and permits the USFWS to manage the population and promote recovery in a manner that is respectful of the needs and concerns of local citizens (Parker and Phillips 1991). Hunting of Red Wolves is prohibited by the ESA. To date, federal protection of the Red Wolf has been adequate to successfully reintroduce and promote recovery of the species in North Carolina.<br/><br/>A very active recovery programme for the Red Wolf has been in existence since the mid-1970s (USFWS 1990; Phillips et al. 2003), with some measures from as early as the mid-1960s (USFWS, unpubl.). By 1976, a captive breeding programme was established using 17 animals captured in Texas and Louisiana (Carley 1975; USFWS 1990). Of these, 14 became the founders of the current captive breeding programme. In 1977, the first pups were born in the captive programme, and by 1985, the captive population had grown to 65 individuals in six zoological facilities (Parker 1986). As of 2017 there were approximately 175 Red Wolves in captivity at 43 facilities throughout the United States and Canada (USFWS, unpubl.). The purpose of the captive population is to safeguard the genetic integrity of the species and to provide animals for reintroduction.&#160;<br/><br/>With the species reasonably secure in captivity, the USFWS began reintroducing Red Wolves at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in north-eastern North Carolina in 1987. As of September 2002, 102 animals have been released with a minimum of 281 descendants produced in the wild since 1987. By 2005, the population had grown to include more than 150 wolves distributed across nearly 6,000 km² of private land (~ 70%) and public land (~30%). The public land included three national wildlife refuges (Alligator River NWR, Pocosin Lakes NWR, and Mattamuskeet NWR) which provided important protection to the wolves. Notably, the USFWS also estimated that over a dozen hybrid canids were also present in north-eastern North Carolina.&#160;<br/><br/>However, by about 2012 the reintroduction project had become mired in significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) that led to a substantial increase in illegal killing of wolves. In response to these characterizations, starting in 2016 the USWFS began taking steps to significantly change the direction of the Red Wolf recovery programme. By 2016 and 2017, changes being cemented into action included: 1) improving the foundation of the captive breeding programme to ensure that the species did not go extinct; 2) restricting free-ranging Red Wolves to about 800 km² of federal lands in mainland Dare County, North Carolina, an area that can support no more than 20 or 30 such animals; 3) returning all Red Wolves found elsewhere in north-eastern North Carolina to captivity to assist with #1 or providing such animals with little or no federal protection; and 4) assessing potential sites throughout the south-eastern United States for future reintroduction projects. Absent successful reintroductions that result in the restoration of several hundred red wolves (at one or a few sites), recovery of the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act will not be possible.<br/><br/>During 1991, a second reintroduction project was initiated at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (Lucash <em>et al</em>. 1999). Thirty-seven Red Wolves were released from 1992 to 1998. Of these, 26 either died or were recaptured after straying onto private lands outside the Park (Henry 1998). Moreover, only five of the 32 pups known to have been born in the wild survived, but were removed from the wild during their first year (USFWS, unpubl.). Biologists suspect that disease, predation, malnutrition, and parasites contributed to the high rate of pup mortality (USFWS, unpubl.). Primarily because of the poor survival of wild-born offspring, the USFWS terminated the Tennessee restoration effort in 1998 (Henry 1998).",

Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-west Louisiana and south-east Texas (Carley 1975; Shaw 1975). However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the south-east (Paradiso and Nowak 1971, 1972; Riley and McBride 1972). Red Wolves reintroduced into north-eastern North Carolina and their descendants have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins. Pocosins are forest/wetland mosaics characterized by an overstory of loblolly and pond pine (<em>Pinus taeda</em> and <em>Pinus serotina</em>, respectively) and an understory of evergreen shrubs (Christensen <em>et al.</em> 1981). This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. The findings of Hahn (2002) seem to support this generalization in that low human density, wetland soil type, and distance from roads were the most important predictor of potential wolf habitat in eastern North Carolina.",

While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in north-eastern North Carolina until approximately 1992 (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 1995). Indeed, north-eastern North Carolina was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes (Parker 1986). However, during the 1990s, the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area (P. Sumner pers. comm.; USFWS, unpubl.). From the start of the reintroduction project in 1987 through to about 2005, the Red Wolf population grew to more than 150 animals. Intensive management was useful at minimizing the extent of hybridization with Coyotes and Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids (Gese and Terletzky 2015, Gese <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, by about 2012, the reintroduction project had become notably characterized by significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) which led to a substantial increase in the illegal killing of Red Wolves."
